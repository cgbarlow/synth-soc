# synth-soc
## Synthetic Society. Creating a synthetic dataset of humans.

An attempt to establish a rich synthetic dataset of people, their associated personal information, situation, life events, history.

This may be used for R&D and application testing purposes where such a dataset would be useful and where using real people's personal information may be problematic.

The intent is to use the dataset to experiment with machine learning applications using techniques such as deep learning, generative adverserial networks and diffusion. The hope is to create a generalised data model which can be tailored and scaled to support various applications.

### Applications
#### Case Management Assistant
One such application for this synthetic dataset may be to demonstrate an assistant for use in case management. The assistant supports the case manager by providing useful contextual information on a client's present situation and can provide suggestions on how best we may assist them. The assistant can read into your client's records and is well-versed in all the available support services and associated rules.

We interface with the assistant by asking questions and creating a dialogue in plain english, as we would when having a conversation with a human. Natural Language Processing is employed for this, as in the current best example of a chat bot: Chat-GPT.
