# synth-soc
Synthetic Society, or synth-soc for short. Creating a synthetic dataset of humans.

An attempt to establish a rich synthetic dataset of people, their associated personal information, situation, life events, history.

This may be used for R&D and application testing purposes where such a dataset would be useful and where using real people's personal information may be problematic.
